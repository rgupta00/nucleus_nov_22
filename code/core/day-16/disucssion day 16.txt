Day 16:
-------
what we did?
	some review about java 8 stream, how hashmap iterate 
	how to sort as per key , value?

Some basic about IO:

char stream vs byte stream
performance consideration:

//What is serilization?
//We have a account object how to serilized it?
	
1. seriliztion is not for staitc data

2. we have to maintain the order of de-serilization ...

3. object graph serilization

4. serilization and compostion

5. writeObject() and readObject() method ...jugaad

6. serilization and inheritance.. instance control flow

7. serilization and sigleton design pattern


class A impl ser..{
}

if base class is ser then all class hierarchy become ser...


//instance control flow*
class A {
}

class B extends A imp.. .Ser..{
}


What happen in case of Composition:

class Collor{
}

class Dog implement Ser...{
	private Collor collor;


}

dog


1. what is ser, and what is de-ser

	storing the state of the object along with some meta data in a file so
	that it can be recovered during de-ser

	used during RMI process
	RMI used by EJB (aka dist tech)

	both party sould use same tech ie java :(


		Web service *

			REST		vs		SOAP

	all special of Ser:

//how to do serilization?
class A imp ser...{
}

ser:
	ObjectOutputStream oos=
				new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("foo.ser"));


des:
	ObjectInputStream ois=
				new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(new File("foo.ser")));
		
Note: if account class dont imp.. ser. then we get run time :NonSerEx...








1. seriliztion is not for staitc data
----------------------------------------
class Account{

	private static String bName="SBI"
}
even if i change bName to PNP even in that case during de-ser we still get SBI


3. ser and compostion:
------------------
class Collar{
}
class Dog{
	private Collar collar;
}



	=> all composite object must also be ser..
	=> if collar is not ser then we can use a KB transient
		no collar for the dog :(


	=> we want to interfare during ser and de-ser 

        private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream oos) throws IOException{
		oos.defaultWriteObject();
		oos.writeInt(collar.size);
		System.out.println("----called during ser----");
	}
	//de-ser
	private void readObject(ObjectInputStream ois) throws ClassNotFoundException, IOException {
		ois.defaultReadObject();
		collar=new Collar();
		collar.size=ois.readInt();
		System.out.println("---called during deser----");
	}




3. ser and inheritance (if i am gupta becase of my father )
class Account imp.. ser{

}

class SA extends Account {
}

:)


case :if base class dont imp.. ser but drive class doing it:
	"instance control flow"


class Account{

}

class SA extends Account {
}

:)


case: if base class dont hv default ctr then
Exception in thread "main" java.io.InvalidClassException: com.day15.session1.io.ser.ex5.B; no valid constructor
